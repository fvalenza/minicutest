MINImalist C UnitTEST framework

Minicutest is a header-only C unittest framework built with the objective to offer unittesting capabilities and reporting. With a primary focus on being minimalist, small and portable(WIP for portability).

No installation, no external compilation, no linking is needed. Just include the header and you're ready to set up a simple yet effective testing environment.
